- [[the yield of a system is theoretically unlimited]]
- [[everything gardens (or modifies it's environment)]]

principles from Permaculture: Principles and Pathways Beyond Sustainability (2002) by David Holmgren:

- [[observe and interact]]
- [[catch and store energy]]
- [[obtain a yield]]
- [[apply self-regulation and accept feedback]]
- [[use & value renewable resources]]
- [[produce no waste]]
- [[design from patterns to details]]
- [[integrate rather than segregate]]
- [[use small and slow solutions]]
- [[use and value diversity]]
- [[use edges and value the marginal]]
