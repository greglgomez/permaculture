# digital circle

## what is the digital circle?

A circle in the Permaculture CoLab, ‘DC’ is a commons facilitated by committed members who believe in supporting learning and innovation at the intersection between digital technology, permaculture design, and ecosocial justice. The circle supports an alliance of micro-enterprises and interest groups, providing a lean organizational infrastructure for freelancers and system designers to build upon. Our foundation is the ethics of [[earth care]], [[people care]], [[fair share]] and [[transition]].
