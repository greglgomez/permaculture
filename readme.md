# Permaculture

Welcome to this experimental open-source permaculture knowledgebase. There are other [[resources]] like it around the web, but most are in disuse, or you can't [[contribute]] to them easily. This one is based on [[foam]].

If you're starting on your permaculture journey, you may want to first learn a bit about [[permaculture-ethics]] or [[permaculture-principles]]
