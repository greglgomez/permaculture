# welcome!

hey there, nice to see you here, this is an experimental open-source permaculture knowledgebase. there are other [[resources]] like it around the web, but most are in disuse, or you can't [[contribute]] to them easily. this one is based on [[foam]].

if you haven't started on your permaculture journey, you should read [[why-permaculture]] is so important.
if you're starting on your permaculture journey, you may want to first dig into [[permaculture-ethics]] & [[permaculture-principles]].
if you're well on your way with your permaculture journey, perhaps you're looking for [[projects]] to be a part of.
